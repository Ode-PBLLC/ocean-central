By the early 2000s,roughly 50% of the world\u2019s coral reefshad disappeared.\nOverone-third of mangrove forestshad been lost by the early 2000s, primarily due to aquaculture and coastal development.\nTechnology and data science have advanced our understanding of the ocean. However, fragmented information still hampers efforts to restore marine ecosystems, posing a global challenge to restoration efforts.\nWave launches Ocean Central to offer a clear, evolving view of ocean health. The platform serves as a catalyst for action, empowering stakeholders to build on successes, address data gaps, and collaborate for a shared vision of a thriving ocean.\nBy 2030, coordinated global efforts can protect 30% of the world\u2019s oceans in line with theU.N.\u2019s SDG 14and theKunming-Montreal Framework.The Paris Agreement\u2019s 1.5\u00b0C targetwill be critical in reducing ocean acidification and slowing sea level rise, paving the way for healthier marine and coastal ecosystems.\nWhile coral bleaching may intensify due to rising temperatures, a clearer understanding of the most at-risk regions will guide restoration projects, helping safeguard key ecosystems through innovative and collaborative regeneration strategies.\nGlobal action can accelerate between now and 2040 to restore vital ecosystems and biodiversity. Continued efforts in restoration and resilience-building will also help protect coastal communities.\nBy 2050, if we continue to act on the best available data and collaborate globally, we will achieve measurable ocean regeneration, ensuring a thriving ocean for generations to come.\nWe built Ocean Central to track progress and inspire action\nWe monitor change over time to ensure we meet our goals\nWe can harness and share insights to guide efforts\nRecord breaking sockeye salmon migration\nand learn from even the smallest of victories.\n01 /ExploreBlue EconomyMarine LifeEcosystems\n02 /TrackProtect Marine LifeProtect SpacesRestore EcosystemsHarvest WiselyReduce PollutionMitigate Climate Change\n03 /StoriesReadListenWatchEvents\n04 /ConnectResourcesMethodology"

        "content": "01 /ExploreBlue EconomyMarine LifeEcosystems\n02 /TrackProtect Marine LifeProtect SpacesRestore EcosystemsHarvest WiselyReduce PollutionMitigate Climate Change\n03 /StoriesReadListenWatchEvents\n04 /ConnectResourcesMethodology\nElevating Blue Tech: Increasing Awareness and Driving Growth - Ocean Central\nElevating Blue Tech: Increasing Awareness and Driving Growth\nInvesting in blue tech is essential for preserving the health of our oceans and coastal areas, which are crucial for economic, social, and environmental resilience.\nDespite its significance, blue tech is often unrecognized, blending into categories such as AI or biotech. Understanding why blue tech is overlooked and how to shift that narrative is key to driving greater awareness, investment, and innovation.\nThe scope of blue tech is broad, encompassing solutions that vary in complexity and application.\nBlue tech refers to innovative and sustainable ocean practices that often leverage advanced technologies. While the blue economy encompasses all economic activities related to the ocean, blue tech is specifically focused on solutions that regenerate and protect marine environments. This sector spans a wide array of industries, from data collection and renewable energy to species and habitat restoration.\nThe scope of blue tech is broad, encompassing solutions that vary in complexity and application. Some innovations focus on organic, nature-based solutions like using seagrass to create sustainable fertilizers, while others push the boundaries of technology, leveraging AI and robotics. Companies such asClearbot, which develops solar-powered boats to clean waterways, andFishcoin, a blockchain-based seafood traceability platform, highlight the spectrum of blue tech, from practical, simple tools to highly advanced technologies.\nThe European Union identifies 12 sub-industries within blue tech, transforming traditional sectors like tourism and shipping into more innovative and regenerative fields.\nBlue biotechnologyslider item toggleRead more\nCoastal tourismslider item toggleRead more\nDesalinationslider item toggleRead more\nInfrastructure and roboticsslider item toggleRead more\nMarine living resourcesslider item toggleRead more\nMarine non-living resourcesslider item toggleRead more\nMarine renewable energyslider item toggleRead more\nMaritime defenseslider item toggleRead more\nMaritime transportslider item toggleRead more\nPort activitiesslider item toggleRead more\nResearch and innovationslider item toggleRead more\nShipbuilding and repairslider item toggleRead more\nEqually diverse are the business models supporting these innovations. Blue tech applies to every sector, from business-to-business (B2B) solutions, such as those improving performance in shipping and tourism, to business-to-government (B2G) partnerships that help public authorities tackle biodiversity, coastal preservation, and sustainability challenges. At the same time, the business-to-consumer (B2C) space is expanding as citizen science gains popularity among ocean enthusiasts. Startups likeOceanium, which creates seaweed-based products for health and conservation, andWsense, a leader in underwater wireless communication, illustrate how blue tech can serve various markets and stakeholders.\nNo matter the application or business model, blue tech provides a dynamic range of solutions that blend innovation with sustainability, helping to advance ocean regeneration while reshaping traditional industries.\nBlue tech is now on par with industries such as gaming, travel, and education in terms of market size and investor interest.\nThe blue economy has been one of thefastest-growing sectors in venture capital, with a nearly 300% increase in funding over the past six years. While it remains smaller than many major sectors \u2014 climate tech, for example, attracted 16 times more funding in 2023 \u2014 blue tech is now on par with industries such as gaming, travel, and education in terms of market size and investor interest.\nThis surge in interest is also supported by global institutions. International organizations such as the World Bank\u2019sPROBLUE programand theUN\u2019s Innovation Acceleratorsare prioritizing ocean innovation, while theWorld Economic Forum\u2019s Uplink initiativesources and promotes ocean-focused solutions. These efforts reflect a growing global commitment to advancing blue tech as a key driver of environmental and economic progress.\nFurther evidence of this momentum comes from public policies and global frameworks such as the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, which set ambitious goals for ocean health. In 2023, investment in blue tech hit a record high, with funds like Ocean 14 Capital\u2019s $200M investment underscoring the sector\u2019s potential. Additionally, philanthropic support from organizations like the Schmidt Family Foundation and the Benioff Ocean Initiative is advancing research and innovation in this space.\nAs blue tech gains traction, its market continues to expand, propelled by the rise of ESG frameworks, evolving regulations, and a cultural shift toward sustainability. Companies such asEcosubsea, which provides sustainable hull cleaning technology that protects marine ecosystems while improving operational efficiency, illustrate how blue tech is becoming integral to responsible business practices.\nOur oceans act as Earth\u2019s most important buffer to climate change, yet blue economy investments still constitute a tiny fraction of climate venture investments.\nPromoting blue tech is not just about giving credit where it is due; it is about unlocking the sector\u2019s full potential. Improved visibility and categorization will make it easier to track blue tech startups, assess their impact, and support their growth. This, in turn, will attract more investors, encourage media coverage, and raise public awareness.\nHowever, this promotion is not an inherent function of blue tech itself but a collective responsibility of the industry\u2019s stakeholders including investors, policymakers, and media. Only through their coordinated efforts can blue tech startups gain the visibility they need to thrive. In essence, it is the ecosystem surrounding blue tech that must work to highlight its value and accelerate its growth.\nTo realize this potential, the ecosystem supporting blue tech must be strengthened. This involves more than promotion; it requires concerted efforts across investment, public policies, infrastructure development, and more.\nDespite its growing importance, blue tech often remains overlooked. This is partly because its innovations are frequently categorized under broader fields like AI, making it difficult for investors and the public to recognize its unique contributions.\nBlue tech is quietly making strides in ocean regeneration. For instance, underwater tractors and drones enhance marine life, and sustainable practices in industries such as agriculture and pharmaceuticals offer environmental and economic benefits. However, without proper promotion, these contributions risk being overshadowed.\nThe lack of clear categorization for blue tech creates challenges for investors, media, and the public. This obscurity limits the visibility of startups and hinders investment flow, even as the blue economy is poised to growtwice as fastas the global economy by 2030.\nFor blue tech to reach its full potential, a concerted effort is needed to build an ecosystem that supports innovation and growth. This includes creating specialized support organizations (SSOs) to assist startups, fostering collaboration among stakeholders, and ensuring a steady flow of funding across all stages of development.\nEstablishing and nurturing connections across the blue economy is crucial.\nSustained Investment:Research has shown that sustainable ocean-based investments yield returns at leastfive times greater than their costs, highlighting the high ROI potential of blue tech. Yet, a critical gap exists in follow-on investments beyond the pre-seed and seed stages, which are essential for startups to scale and thrive.\nPublic Policies and Regulation:Decarbonization, biodiversity restoration, and ESG frameworks are driving innovation in blue tech. Effective regulations can catalyze the development of new technologies and practices that benefit both the environment and the economy.\nInfrastructure Development:Advancements in ocean-related infrastructure, such as hydrogen, wind, and tidal energy, are proving to be critical to blue tech\u2019s success. Projects liketransforming sea walls into reefs, which foster biodiversity, exemplify how infrastructure can serve both functional and environmental purposes.\nEcosystem Building:\u201cEstablishing and nurturing connections across the blue economy is crucial,\u201d says Alexis Grosskopf, founder ofOcean Hub Africa. \u201cBy fostering collaborations between entrepreneurs, investors, policymakers, and communities, we can catalyze innovation, unlock sustainable practices, and accelerate positive impacts on both the environment and livelihoods. Building these bridges to empower ocean-impact ventures will shape a more equitable and sustainable future for our oceans and our planet.\u201d\nPromotion and Awareness:Raising awareness of blue tech\u2019s impact and potential is crucial for attracting investment and driving innovation. By collectively highlighting the successes of blue tech startups and the broader industry, we can help unlock its full potential and make meaningful strides toward a sustainable future for our oceans.\nWe are at the beginning of a long journey to elevate blue tech as a high-growth industry with limitless opportunities. Many tools and technologies are already in place; now it is about recognizing their potential and leveraging them effectively. By working together to better promote and highlight blue tech, we can drive significant progress in ocean regeneration and ensure a sustainable future for our planet.\n\u201cPromoting blue tech and shifting public perception to fully recognize its potential is critical to unlocking its growth and restoring our oceans,\u201d says Alexandra Cousteau, president and co-founder ofOceans 2050.\nIf you are involved in blue tech or know of an innovative company in this space, the team at Wave would love to hear from you. Together, we can bring these innovations into the spotlight and ensure blue tech receives the recognition it deserves.\nWith thanks to Ingrid Maurstad and Alexis Grosskop\nWith thanks to Ingrid Maurstad and Alexis Grosskop\nSalma\n                                        BaghdadiInnovation Lead at WaveSalma Baghdadi is an ocean advocate and a driving force in blue tech ecosystems.

Understanding why blue tech is overlooked and how to shift that narrative is key to driving greater awareness, investment, and innovation.\nThe scope of blue tech is broad, encompassing solutions that vary in complexity and application.\nBlue tech refers to innovative and sustainable ocean practices that often leverage advanced technologies. While the blue economy encompasses all economic activities related to the ocean, blue tech is specifically focused on solutions that regenerate and protect marine environments. This sector spans a wide array of industries, from data collection and renewable energy to species and habitat restoration.\nThe scope of blue tech is broad, encompassing solutions that vary in complexity and application. Some innovations focus on organic, nature-based solutions like using seagrass to create sustainable fertilizers, while others push the boundaries of technology, leveraging AI and robotics. Companies such asClearbot, which develops solar-powered boats to clean waterways, andFishcoin, a blockchain-based seafood traceability platform, highlight the spectrum of blue tech, from practical, simple tools to highly advanced technologies.\nThe European Union identifies 12 sub-industries within blue tech, transforming traditional sectors like tourism and shipping into more innovative and regenerative fields.\nBlue biotechnologyslider item toggleRead more\nCoastal tourismslider item toggleRead more\nDesalinationslider item toggleRead more\nInfrastructure and roboticsslider item toggleRead more\nMarine living resourcesslider item toggleRead more\nMarine non-living resourcesslider item toggleRead more\nMarine renewable energyslider item toggleRead more\nMaritime defenseslider item toggleRead more\nMaritime transportslider item toggleRead more\nPort activitiesslider item toggleRead more\nResearch and innovationslider item toggleRead more\nShipbuilding and repairslider item toggleRead more\nEqually diverse are the business models supporting these innovations. Blue tech applies to every sector, from business-to-business (B2B) solutions, such as those improving performance in shipping and tourism, to business-to-government (B2G) partnerships that help public authorities tackle biodiversity, coastal preservation, and sustainability challenges. At the same time, the business-to-consumer (B2C) space is expanding as citizen science gains popularity among ocean enthusiasts. Startups likeOceanium, which creates seaweed-based products for health and conservation, andWsense, a leader in underwater wireless communication, illustrate how blue tech can serve various markets and stakeholders.\nNo matter the application or business model, blue tech provides a dynamic range of solutions that blend innovation with sustainability, helping to advance ocean regeneration while reshaping traditional industries.\nBlue tech is now on par with industries such as gaming, travel, and education in terms of market size and investor interest.\nThe blue economy has been one of thefastest-growing sectors in venture capital, with a nearly 300% increase in funding over the past six years. While it remains smaller than many major sectors \u2014 climate tech, for example, attracted 16 times more funding in 2023 \u2014 blue tech is now on par with industries such as gaming, travel, and education in terms of market size and investor interest.\nThis surge in interest is also supported by global institutions. International organizations such as the World Bank\u2019sPROBLUE programand theUN\u2019s Innovation Acceleratorsare prioritizing ocean innovation, while theWorld Economic Forum\u2019s Uplink initiativesources and promotes ocean-focused solutions. These efforts reflect a growing global commitment to advancing blue tech as a key driver of environmental and economic progress.\nFurther evidence of this momentum comes from public policies and global frameworks such as the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, which set ambitious goals for ocean health. In 2023, investment in blue tech hit a record high, with funds like Ocean 14 Capital\u2019s $200M investment underscoring the sector\u2019s potential. Additionally, philanthropic support from organizations like the Schmidt Family Foundation and the Benioff Ocean Initiative is advancing research and innovation in this space.\nAs blue tech gains traction, its market continues to expand, propelled by the rise of ESG frameworks, evolving regulations, and a cultural shift toward sustainability. Companies such asEcosubsea, which provides sustainable hull cleaning technology that protects marine ecosystems while improving operational efficiency, illustrate how blue tech is becoming integral to responsible business practices.\nOur oceans act as Earth\u2019s most important buffer to climate change, yet blue economy investments still constitute a tiny fraction of climate venture investments.\nPromoting blue tech is not just about giving credit where it is due; it is about unlocking the sector\u2019s full potential. Improved visibility and categorization will make it easier to track blue tech startups, assess their impact, and support their growth. This, in turn, will attract more investors, encourage media coverage, and raise public awareness.\nHowever, this promotion is not an inherent function of blue tech itself but a collective responsibility of the industry\u2019s stakeholders including investors, policymakers, and media. Only through their coordinated efforts can blue tech startups gain the visibility they need to thrive. In essence, it is the ecosystem surrounding blue tech that must work to highlight its value and accelerate its growth.\nTo realize this potential, the ecosystem supporting blue tech must be strengthened. This involves more than promotion; it requires concerted efforts across investment, public policies, infrastructure development, and more.\nDespite its growing importance, blue tech often remains overlooked. This is partly because its innovations are frequently categorized under broader fields like AI, making it difficult for investors and the public to recognize its unique contributions.\nBlue tech is quietly making strides in ocean regeneration. For instance, underwater tractors and drones enhance marine life, and sustainable practices in industries such as agriculture and pharmaceuticals offer environmental and economic benefits. However, without proper promotion, these contributions risk being overshadowed.\nThe lack of clear categorization for blue tech creates challenges for investors, media, and the public. This obscurity limits the visibility of startups and hinders investment flow, even as the blue economy is poised to growtwice as fastas the global economy by 2030.\nFor blue tech to reach its full potential, a concerted effort is needed to build an ecosystem that supports innovation and growth. This includes creating specialized support organizations (SSOs) to assist startups, fostering collaboration among stakeholders, and ensuring a steady flow of funding across all stages of development.\nEstablishing and nurturing connections across the blue economy is crucial.\nSustained Investment:Research has shown that sustainable ocean-based investments yield returns at leastfive times greater than their costs, highlighting the high ROI potential of blue tech. Yet, a critical gap exists in follow-on investments beyond the pre-seed and seed stages, which are essential for startups to scale and thrive.\nPublic Policies and Regulation:Decarbonization, biodiversity restoration, and ESG frameworks are driving innovation in blue tech. Effective regulations can catalyze the development of new technologies and practices that benefit both the environment and the economy.\nInfrastructure Development:Advancements in ocean-related infrastructure, such as hydrogen, wind, and tidal energy, are proving to be critical to blue tech\u2019s success. Projects liketransforming sea walls into reefs, which foster biodiversity, exemplify how infrastructure can serve both functional and environmental purposes.\nEcosystem Building:\u201cEstablishing and nurturing connections across the blue economy is crucial,\u201d says Alexis Grosskopf, founder ofOcean Hub Africa. \u201cBy fostering collaborations between entrepreneurs, investors, policymakers, and communities, we can catalyze innovation, unlock sustainable practices, and accelerate positive impacts on both the environment and livelihoods. Building these bridges to empower ocean-impact ventures will shape a more equitable and sustainable future for our oceans and our planet.\u201d\nPromotion and Awareness:Raising awareness of blue tech\u2019s impact and potential is crucial for attracting investment and driving innovation. By collectively highlighting the successes of blue tech startups and the broader industry, we can help unlock its full potential and make meaningful strides toward a sustainable future for our oceans.\nWe are at the beginning of a long journey to elevate blue tech as a high-growth industry with limitless opportunities. Many tools and technologies are already in place; now it is about recognizing their potential and leveraging them effectively. By working together to better promote and highlight blue tech, we can drive significant progress in ocean regeneration and ensure a sustainable future for our planet.\n\u201cPromoting blue tech and shifting public perception to fully recognize its potential is critical to unlocking its growth and restoring our oceans,\u201d says Alexandra Cousteau, president and co-founder ofOceans 2050.\nIf you are involved in blue tech or know of an innovative company in this space, the team at Wave would love to hear from you. Together, we can bring these innovations into the spotlight and ensure blue tech receives the recognition it deserves.\nWith thanks to Ingrid Maurstad and Alexis Grosskop\nWith thanks to Ingrid Maurstad and Alexis Grosskop\nSalma\n                                        BaghdadiInnovation Lead at WaveSalma Baghdadi is an ocean advocate and a driving force in blue tech ecosystems.

The ocean has absorbed more than 90% of the excess heat derived from the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration. As a result, global surface temperatures show a steady rise in ocean temperatures since 1880, with a sharper increase in recent years. \u201cOcean warming has been accelerating to match the extent of atmospheric warming,\u201d says Carlos Duarte, chief scientist for Ocean Central and author of \u201cOcean: The Secret of Planet Earth.\u201d\nThis warming trend is causing significant changes in the marine environment. For instance, warmer oceans can lead to more frequent coral bleaching, where stressed corals expel the algae they rely on for nutrients and color. This affects entire coral ecosystems and a wide variety of marine species that depend on them for food and shelter. The Great Barrier Reef, for instance, is home to400 species of coraland 1,500 species of fish.\nRecent heat stress has led to widespread bleaching, or what scientists call \u201cmass coral bleaching events.\u201d Mass bleaching has beenincreasing in frequencyas the ocean continues to warm. In fact, from the start of 2023 to mid-2024, mass bleaching occurred in at least 70 countries and territories worldwide, according toNOAA.\nHigher temperatures are melting ice in the polar regions at an alarming rate. Greenland and Antarctica are losing hundreds of gigatons of ice per year, which directly contributes to rising sea levels. Greenland\u2019s melting ice sheet is one of the largest contributors to global sea level rise, according to a study inNature. In addition to the release of freshwater from melting ice caps, the ocean is also expanding due to warming, as warmer water is less dense and therefore occupies a larger volume for the same mass. This is known as thermal expansion.\nSea level rise is unevenly distributed across the globe. Some areas, like the western Pacific and Indian Oceans, are experiencing greater increases. This putscoastal regions, especially in low-lying areas, at higher risk of flooding and storm surges, endangering ecosystems and millions of people, particularly where resources to mitigate these impacts are limited.\nThe risks of fooding and salinization of aquifers derived from sea level rise are further aggravated in many coastal areas worldwide by subsidence, where the ground level sinks due to compaction when groundwater is extracted.\nClimate change can have a profound effect on ocean currents, altering their path, speed, and volume transported.\nThe ocean\u2019s response to rising temperatures goes far beyond coastal communities and marine life \u2014 it is a global issue that affects weather patterns, food security, and human livelihoods around the world.\nChanges in ocean currents can disrupt climate systems and even affect agricultural productivity. Understanding these interconnected dynamics is crucial for addressing the broader implications of climate change.\nA system known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), often described as the ocean\u2019s \u201cconveyor belt,\u201d helps regulate global climate by moving warm water from the tropics to the North Atlantic.\nChanges in this circulation pattern are not only relevant to the ocean environment and coastal communities but they also influence our climate on land and everyday weather patterns through the seasons. Increased freshwater from melting ice and more intense rainfall are weakening and changing this circulation. AMOC redistributes heat from tropical regions to high latitude regions. For this reason, a weaker AMOC is expected to lead to colder winters in Europe and warmer tropics, shifts in tropical rainfall patterns, and more severe hurricanes, impacting weather in towns around the world and showing just how connected our climate systems are.\nClimate change is largely driven by carbon dioxide emissions. The ocean, acting as a fluid in balance with the atmosphere, absorbs excess heat and CO2, having taken up about a third of the CO2 released by human activity. While this helps buffer climate warming, the added CO2 changes ocean chemistry by lowering pH levels and reducing carbonate ions.\nThese changes make it harder for many marine organisms to form shells and skeletons. Additionally, oxygen levels in the ocean are dropping due to warmer water holding less oxygen and marine organisms using more of it as their respiration rates increase with temperature. This gradual loss of oxygen adds further stress to marine ecosystems.\nThe changes we see in the ocean reflect broader climate impacts. Warmer and more acidic ocean water affects marine life, fisheries, and global food security. As ocean conditions shift,fish populations migrate, disrupting fishing industries and the communities that depend on them. Melting ice also opens new shipping routes and access to resources, with significant geopolitical implications.\nThe data paints a clear picture: our oceans are warming, ice is melting, sea levels are rising, and vital ocean currents are slowing. These changes impact not only the physical landscape of our planet but also marine ecosystems and coastal communities.\nTo address these challenges, we need urgent action and innovation to mitigate climate change and support ocean regeneration. By taking steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and investing in blue tech solutions, we can begin to rebuild the ocean\u2019s health and resilience, paving the way for a sustainable future.\nDelworth, T.

Much of this data was being ignored or, worse, lost altogether,\u201d says Carlos Duarte, chief scientist at Ocean Central and author of \u201cOcean: The Secret of Planet Earth.\u201d\nWhile we have advanced tools at our disposal, we are still facing some big challenges when it comes to ocean data.
